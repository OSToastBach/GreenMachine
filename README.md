# The Green Machine
A Dragon 32 demo tape duo released at Field-FX 2022
Achieved 1st place in the Demo compo!

To compile, make disks and run you must have asm6809, dragondos and xroar installed, and then it is as simple as running the build in compile.bat file

I hope to see more Dragon 32 demos :)
